# Project application: gem5

## Application

### Sandbox application

* Project name: gem5
* Project repo(s):
  * All repos: https://gem5.googlesource.com/
  * Main repo: https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5/
  * Resources (e.g., disk images, benchmarks): https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-resources/
  * Website: https://gem5.googlesource.com/public/gem5-website/
  * GitHub mirror: https://github.com/gem5/
* Brief summary of the project:

The gem5 simulator is a modular platform for computer-system architecture research, encompassing system-level architecture as well as processor microarchitecture. gem5 is a community led project with an open governance model.

gem5 was originally conceived for computer architecture research in academia, but it has grown to be used in computer system design by academia, industry for research, and in teaching.

More information can be found in the [gem5-20.0+ paper on ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03152.pdf).

* Link to website: http://www.gem5.org/
* Links to social media accounts: N/A
* Who uses this project, and at what scale: Computer architecture researchers in academia and industry and teachers and students in undergraduate and graduate education. We estimate 1000-2000 regular users.
* Why does the project want to join CHIPS Alliance: We hope that CHIPS Alliance can bring stability, maturity, and sustainability to the gem5 community project. We believe that gem5 is a good fit for CHIPS Alliance by providing a system-level simulation interface that is higher-level than RTL simulation but can provide better timing estimates than functional-only simulation.
